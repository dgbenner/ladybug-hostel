# 🐞 Ladybug Hostel

**A mobile-friendly web app to help people safely overwinter ladybugs in cold climates**

## Project Description

Ladybug Hostel is an educational web application designed to help apartment and home dwellers in cold climates understand how to care for ladybugs during winter months. When temperatures drop below 50°F, ladybugs enter a hibernation-like state called diapause and seek warm shelter—often ending up inside homes. Rather than letting them perish or putting them back outside where they'll freeze, this app teaches people how to become temporary "hostel operators" for these beneficial insects until spring.

## Why This Matters

**Ladybugs are beneficial insects** that control pest populations by eating aphids and other harmful insects. In Minnesota and similar cold climates, ladybugs naturally seek indoor shelter during fall and winter. With proper care, you can help them survive until spring when they can return outdoors to continue their important work in gardens and ecosystems.

## Key Facts About Overwintering Ladybugs

### Biology & Behavior

**Diapause (Hibernation State)**
- Ladybugs enter diapause when temperatures drop, typically below 50°F
- During diapause, they live off stored fat reserves for up to 9 months
- Their shell colors fade and become dull when dormant
- They cannot fly below 55°F
- They naturally cluster in groups for warmth and protection

**Species Identification**
- **Native Ladybugs**: Small, round, bright red with black spots
- **Asian Lady Beetles**: Larger, more oval, orange-to-yellow color with an M or W marking where head meets wings
- Asian lady beetles are more likely to invade homes in large numbers
- Both species are beneficial but Asian lady beetles can bite and release foul-smelling yellow secretions when disturbed

**Natural Overwintering Sites**
- Rock crevices and cliff faces
- Tree bark and hollow trees
- Leaf litter
- Building cracks and crevices (especially south and west-facing walls)

### Indoor Survival

**Why They Come Inside**
- Attracted to warmth and light from windows
- Seeking shelter before winter sets in
- Prefer light-colored, older homes
- Enter through small cracks, gaps in windows, door frames

**The Indoor Problem**
- Heated homes disrupt natural diapause cycles
- They wake up prematurely without food sources
- Without proper care, they slowly deplete energy reserves and die
- They don't reproduce indoors during winter

**Lifespan**
- In nature: 2-3 years with proper hibernation
- Indoors without care: 2-4 months
- With proper overwintering care: Can survive until spring release

## How to Care for Ladybugs Indoors

### Option 1: Proper Hibernation (Recommended)

**Setup:**
- Container with ventilation holes (small box, jar, or terrarium)
- Cool, dark location (unheated garage, shed, or basement)
- Ideal temperature: 40-50°F (cold enough for dormancy, warm enough to prevent freezing)
- Moist paper towel (replaced when dry) for humidity
- Multiple ladybugs together for warmth (they naturally cluster)

**Care During Hibernation:**
- No food needed—they live off fat reserves
- Maintain moisture with damp paper towel (not dripping wet)
- Keep in darkness to prevent early awakening
- Check occasionally for mold (change bedding if needed)
- Do not disturb frequently

### Option 2: Active Care (If Already Awake)

**If ladybugs are awake and active in warm indoor spaces:**

**Housing:**
- Small ventilated container (4"x7" or similar)
- Shredded paper or leaves on bottom
- Folded cardboard for climbing
- Room temperature environment

**Food:**
- **First choice**: Live aphids (check houseplants)
- **Emergency food**: 
  - Honey on a cotton swab (wake-up energy boost)
  - Soaked raisins (plain, soaked in water for a few minutes)
  - Romaine lettuce (some individuals accept it)
  - Sugar water (1:1 mix)
  - Pollen if available
- Feed small amounts every 2-3 days

**Water:**
- Damp paper towel (not soaking)
- Small cotton ball moistened with water
- Shallow dish with pebbles and water
- Change daily to prevent mold

**Important Notes:**
- Active care is labor-intensive and not ideal for ladybugs
- Mold is a serious risk—change food/water frequently
- Best to transition to hibernation conditions if possible
- Release outdoors in spring when temperatures stabilize above 55°F

### Option 3: Gentle Relocation

**If you don't want to keep them:**
- Use vacuum with new bag to collect gently (don't crush)
- Remove vacuum bag immediately
- Release in unheated shed, garage, or protected outdoor spot
- Never squish them—they release foul-smelling yellow fluid that stains

## Safety & Handling

**Do:**
- Handle gently with soft paintbrush or paper
- Keep multiple together for warmth
- Maintain appropriate temperature
- Release in spring when temperatures are consistently warm

**Don't:**
- Never squish or crush (causes staining and odor)
- Don't overheat (disrupts hibernation)
- Don't expose to pesticides
- Don't leave in direct sunlight
- Don't keep long-term as active pets (survival requires proper hibernation)

**Signs of Health:**
- Hibernating: Still, dull coloring, minimal movement
- Healthy active: Bright colors, climbing, attempting to fly above 55°F
- Playing dead: May stay still when threatened, wait a few minutes

## App Features (Planned)

### Core Functionality

   - Community sharing

### Technical Features

- Progressive Web App (mobile-friendly)

## Regional Considerations

**Cold Climates (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Vermont, etc.):**
- Expect ladybugs indoors from October-March
- Outdoor release: Late April-May when temps consistently above 55°F
- High likelihood of finding them on windows in fall

**Moderate Climates:**
- Shorter overwintering period
- May not need full hibernation setup
- Release earlier in spring

## Scientific Background

**Diapause Mechanism:**
- Triggered by shorter day length and cooler temperatures
- Metabolic rate drops significantly
- Body produces antifreeze compounds (glycerol, proteins)
- Fat reserves accumulated before winter sustain them

**Aggregation Behavior:**
- Ladybugs release pheromones to signal good overwintering sites
- Clustering provides thermal mass and humidity
- Historical aggregation sites used year after year

**Note**: While ladybugs can survive with care, they are wild insects best suited for outdoor life. This app helps bridge the gap when they inadvertently enter homes in cold climates, ensuring their survival until proper spring release.
